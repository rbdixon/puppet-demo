# Getting started

After cloning the repo and ensuring that vagrant with the VirtualBox provider is operational:

1. Initialize submodules: `git submodule init; git submodule update`
2. Start vagrant: `vagrant up`. Puppet will execute and complete the provisioning of the box.
3. Visit the page [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This example has been tested on Vagrant 1.4.1 hosted on Mac OS X 10.8.5.
